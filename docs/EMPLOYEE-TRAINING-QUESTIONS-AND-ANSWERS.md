**Options:**
1. Personal Health Information
2. **Protected Health Information** ✅ (Correct Answer: Option 2)
3. Patient Hospital Information

**Question PASSWORD-01:** What is a strong password?

**Options:**
1. Your name followed by your birth year (e.g., John1985)

4. Your username with numbers added (e.g., Admin2024)

**Explanation:** A strong password should be at least 12 characters long and include a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. This makes it much harder for attackers to guess or crack your password.

---

**Question PASSWORD-02:** How often should you change your password?

**Options:**

2. Every 6 months
3. **Every 90 days** ✅ (Correct Answer: Option 3)

2. **You should only access the minimum amount of PHI needed to do your job** ✅ (Correct Answer: Option 2)
3. You can access patient information only on Mondays

---

**Options:**
1. Your access should remain the same
2. **Your old access should be removed and new access granted based on your new role** ✅ (Correct Answer: Option 2)
3. You should keep both old and new access
