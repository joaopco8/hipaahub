    {
      question: "What is the difference between manual and automated HIPAA compliance?",
      answer: "Manual compliance involves creating policies yourself, conducting risk assessments manually, managing training records in spreadsheets, and organizing evidence manually. Automated compliance uses software to generate policies, conduct risk assessments, manage training, and organize evidence automatically."
    },
    {
      question: "How much time does automated compliance software save?",
      answer: "Automated compliance software saves 20-40 hours per month compared to manual compliance. Initial setup takes 2-4 hours vs. 40-80 hours manually. Ongoing maintenance takes 1-2 hours/month vs. 20-40 hours/month manually."
    },
    {
      question: "Is automated compliance software worth the cost?",
      answer: "Yes. Automated compliance software costs $499/year but saves 20-40 hours/month. At $50/hour, that's $12,000-$24,000/year in time savings. ROI is 2,400%-4,800%. Plus, it reduces errors and ensures completeness."
    },
    {
      question: "Can small practices use automated compliance software?",
      answer: "Yes. Automated compliance software is designed for small practices. It's actually more valuable for small practices because they don't have compliance departments. HIPAA Hub costs $499/year vs. $50,000-$100,000/year for a compliance officer."

- Spends 25 hours/month on compliance
- **Total: 360 hours/year = $18,000**

**Automated approach (HIPAA Hub):**
- Spent 3 hours setting up
- Spends 1.5 hours/month on compliance
- **Total: 21 hours/year = $499**

**Savings:** 339 hours/year, $17,501/year

### Example 2: 5-Person Clinic

**Manual approach:**
- Hired consultant: $15,000/year
- Owner spends 10 hours/month: $6,000/year
