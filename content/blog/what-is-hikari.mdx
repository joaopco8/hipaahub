# Security Risk Analysis (SRA): a defensible approach for small clinics

A HIPAA Security Risk Analysis is not a survey. It is a documented, repeatable process that shows:

- what systems touch electronic PHI (ePHI)
- what could go wrong (threats and vulnerabilities)
- what safeguards exist today (with evidence)
- what you will fix next (risk management plan)

OCR expects you to be able to show your work. If you can’t produce a structured risk analysis and a remediation trail, you’re exposed.

## What counts as a risk analysis (in practice)

At minimum, your risk analysis should include:

- **System inventory**: EHR, email, laptops, phones, servers, cloud storage, backups, network gear, third-party vendors.
- **Data flow**: where ePHI is created, stored, transmitted, and accessed.
- **Threats**: phishing, lost devices, insider misuse, misconfiguration, ransomware, vendor compromise.
- **Vulnerabilities**: no MFA, shared accounts, weak endpoint management, missing backups testing, unclear access provisioning.
- **Existing safeguards**: MFA screenshots, encryption settings, access logging, role-based access policies, training records.
- **Risk rating**: impact × likelihood (be consistent).
- **Remediation plan**: owners, due dates, and evidence of completion.

## A simple scoring model that works

Pick a scale and stick to it. For example:

- Likelihood: 1 (rare) → 5 (frequent)
- Impact: 1 (low) → 5 (severe)
- Risk score = likelihood × impact

Then define thresholds (example):
- 1–6 low
- 7–12 moderate
- 13–25 high

## Evidence: what actually makes it defensible

For each high-risk item, attach evidence that proves the safeguard exists (or does not exist yet). Examples:

- MFA enforcement screenshot (Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, EHR vendor)
- Encryption settings (device encryption, cloud storage encryption at rest)
- Backup configuration and restore test record
- Access logs and retention settings
- Workforce training completion list and certificate evidence

If your policy says “we enforce MFA,” your evidence must show MFA is enforced.

## How often should you redo the SRA?

At least annually—and also after major changes such as:
- new EHR or vendor platform
- major network change
- staff growth, new locations
- a security incident or near-miss
- moving email/storage providers

## What clinic owners should do next

1. Build your inventory of systems and vendors touching ePHI.
2. Identify your top 10 risks and attach evidence to each.
3. Create a remediation plan with clear owners and deadlines.
4. Track completion with proof (screenshots, logs, vendor confirmations).

This is how compliance becomes defensible.
