# HIPAA Breach Notification: What You Must Do (Legal Requirements)

**A breach happened. You have 60 days. Here's exactly what you must do.**

This guide covers all HIPAA breach notification requirements—what, when, and how to notify.

## What is a HIPAA Breach?

A HIPAA breach is the **acquisition, access, use, or disclosure** of Protected Health Information (PHI) in a manner not permitted by HIPAA, which **compromises the security or privacy** of the PHI.

### What Counts as a Breach?

**Examples of breaches:**
- Lost or stolen laptop with unencrypted PHI
- Email sent to wrong patient
- Hacking incident
- Unauthorized access to patient records
- Paper records left in public place
- Vendor breach affecting your patients

**What doesn't count:**
- Encrypted data that's lost (if encryption key wasn't compromised)
- Unintentional disclosure to authorized person
- Good faith disclosure that couldn't be prevented

## The 60-Day Rule

**You have 60 days from discovery to notify patients.**

**Key points:**
- Clock starts when you **know** (or should have known) about the breach
- Not when the breach occurred
- Not when you finish investigating
- **60 days. Period.**

**What happens if you miss the deadline?**
- Additional fines
- OCR investigation
- Reputational damage
- Legal liability

## Step 1: Detect and Contain

### Immediate Actions (Day 1)

**What to do:**
1. **Detect the breach** - Identify what happened
2. **Contain it** - Stop further exposure
3. **Document it** - Record when discovered, what happened
4. **Assess scope** - How many patients affected?

**Timeline:** Within 24 hours of discovery

### Containment Steps

**Technical containment:**
- Disable compromised accounts
- Change passwords
- Isolate affected systems
- Restore from backups (if needed)

**Physical containment:**
- Secure physical documents
- Restrict access to affected areas
- Recover lost devices (if possible)

## Step 2: Assess the Breach

### Risk Assessment

**Determine:**
1. **What PHI was involved?** - Names, SSNs, medical records?
2. **How many patients?** - Affects notification requirements
3. **Risk of harm?** - Financial, reputational, or other harm?
4. **Was data encrypted?** - Affects breach determination

### Breach Determination

**Four factors to consider:**
1. **Nature and extent of PHI** - What information was involved?
2. **Person who used/disclosed PHI** - Authorized or unauthorized?
3. **Whether PHI was acquired/viewed** - Was it actually accessed?
4. **Extent of risk mitigation** - What steps were taken?

## Step 3: Notify Affected Patients

### Patient Notification Requirements

**Timeline:** Within 60 days of discovery

**Method:** Written notice (first-class mail) or email (if patient agreed)

**Content required:**
1. **Description of breach** - What happened?
2. **Types of information involved** - What PHI was compromised?
3. **What you're doing** - Investigation, mitigation, prevention
4. **What patients should do** - Steps to protect themselves
5. **Contact information** - Who to call with questions

### Notification Letter Template

**Required elements:**
- Clear, plain language
- Specific to the breach
- Actionable steps for patients
- Contact information
- Offer of credit monitoring (if appropriate)

**Sample structure:**
```
Dear [Patient Name],

We are writing to inform you of a security incident that may have 
affected your protected health information.

What Happened:
[Description of breach]

What Information Was Involved:
[Types of PHI]

What We're Doing:
[Investigation and mitigation steps]

What You Should Do:
[Steps for patients]

Contact Information:
[Phone, email, address]

Sincerely,
[Practice Name]
```

## Step 4: Notify HHS OCR

### OCR Notification Requirements

**For breaches affecting 500+ individuals:**
- Notify OCR **within 60 days** of discovery
- Use OCR's breach notification form
- Include all required information

**For breaches affecting fewer than 500 individuals:**
- Notify OCR **within 60 days of the end of the calendar year**
- Submit log of all breaches for the year
- Use OCR's breach notification form

### OCR Notification Form

**Required information:**
- Practice information
- Breach description
- Number of individuals affected
- Types of PHI involved
- Steps taken to mitigate
- Patient notification status

## Step 5: Notify Media (If Required)

### Media Notification Requirements

**When required:**
- Breach affects **500+ individuals** in a **state or jurisdiction**
- Must notify **prominent media outlets** serving that area
- Timeline: **Within 60 days** of discovery

**What to include:**
- Same information as patient notification
- Written in plain language
- Contact information for questions

**Media outlets:**
- Major newspapers
- Television stations
- Radio stations
- Online news outlets

## Step 6: Document Everything

### Documentation Requirements

**What to document:**
1. **Breach discovery** - When, how, who discovered
2. **Breach assessment** - Risk analysis, scope determination
3. **Containment steps** - What was done to stop breach
4. **Investigation** - Findings, root cause analysis
5. **Notifications sent** - When, to whom, method
6. **Remediation** - Steps taken to prevent future breaches

**Why documentation matters:**
- Required for audits
- Shows good faith effort
- Reduces potential fines
- Demonstrates compliance

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Waiting Too Long

**Problem:** Waiting to finish investigation before notifying

**Solution:** Notify within 60 days, even if investigation is ongoing

### Mistake 2: Incomplete Notifications

**Problem:** Missing required information

**Solution:** Use checklist to ensure all elements included

### Mistake 3: Poor Documentation

**Problem:** Not documenting breach response

**Solution:** Document everything from day 1

### Mistake 4: Not Notifying OCR

**Problem:** Forgetting to notify OCR for small breaches

**Solution:** Log all breaches and notify OCR annually
