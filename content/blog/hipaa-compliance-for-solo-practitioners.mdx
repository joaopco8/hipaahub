# HIPAA Compliance for Solo Practitioners (1-Person Practice)

**Solo practitioners face unique challenges. Here's how to stay compliant without breaking the bank.**

Solo practitioners handle everything: patient care, billing, scheduling, and compliance. You don't have a compliance department. You don't have a big budget. But you still need HIPAA compliance—or risk fines, audits, and patient trust.

## Why Solo Practitioners Are Different

**Solo practices face unique challenges:**

- **No compliance department**: You're managing compliance alone
- **Limited budget**: Can't afford a $50-100k/year compliance officer
- **Time constraints**: Balancing patient care with compliance
- **Limited IT support**: Often managing technology yourself
- **All responsibilities**: Privacy Officer, Security Officer, and everything else

**The problem:** Most solo practitioners don't realize they need HIPAA compliance until they get an audit notice or have a breach.

## Solo Practitioner HIPAA Checklist

### 1. Privacy Policies

**Required:**
- Privacy Notice (Notice of Privacy Practices)
- Patient authorization forms
- Minimum necessary policy
- Patient rights documentation

**Solo-specific:**
- How to handle patient requests when you're the only one
- Backup procedures if you're unavailable
- Communication policy

### 2. Security Policies

**Required:**
- Security policies covering all three safeguard categories
- Access control policies
- Encryption policies
- Workstation security policies

**Solo-specific:**
- How to secure your workstation when you're the only user
- Backup and recovery procedures
- Mobile device security (if you work from multiple locations)

### 3. Business Associate Agreements (BAAs)

**Solo practitioners typically need BAAs with:**
- Billing services
- EHR providers
- Cloud storage providers
- IT support companies
- Answering services
- Marketing agencies (if they handle patient data)

**Most solo practitioners miss:** BAAs with billing services and cloud storage providers.

### 4. Risk Assessment

**Solo-specific risks:**
- Single point of failure (you're the only one)
- Limited IT security knowledge
- Mobile device access
- Cloud storage security
- Backup and recovery

**Required:** Annual risk assessment documenting all risks and mitigation strategies.

### 5. Staff Training

**Required:**
- HIPAA training for yourself (yes, you need it too)
- Training records maintained
- Annual refresher training

**Most solo practitioners fail:** Not documenting their own training or missing annual refresher training.

### 6. Designated Roles

**Required:**
- Privacy Officer (that's you)
- Security Officer (that's you too)
- Documentation of roles

**Solo-specific:** You wear multiple hats, but you still need to document who's responsible for what.
