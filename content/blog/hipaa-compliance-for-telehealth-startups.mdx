# HIPAA Compliance for Telehealth Startups (New Telehealth Practice)

**Telehealth startups have unique HIPAA requirements. Here's what you need to know.**

Telehealth is growing fast. But if you're starting a telehealth practice, you need HIPAA compliance from day one. Video platforms, patient consent, session security, and data transmission all have specific requirements.

## Why Telehealth Startups Are Different

**Telehealth practices face unique challenges:**

- **Video platform security**: Must use HIPAA-compliant platforms
- **Patient consent**: Special consent requirements for telehealth
- **Session recording**: If you record sessions, additional requirements
- **Data transmission**: Patient data transmitted over internet must be encrypted
- **BAAs with platforms**: Must have BAAs with video platform providers
- **State regulations**: Some states have additional telehealth requirements

**The problem:** Most telehealth startups don't realize they need HIPAA compliance until they get an audit notice or have a breach.
