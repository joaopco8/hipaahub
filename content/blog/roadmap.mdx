An incident is stressful. OCR expects disciplined documentation.

This guide focuses on operational steps a clinic owner can implement to make breach handling defensible.

## What counts as a breach (in practice)

Not every security incident is a reportable breach, but every incident should be documented. Examples that often trigger breach workflows:

- lost or stolen device with possible ePHI exposure
- misdirected email containing patient information
- ransomware affecting systems that store or access ePHI
- vendor compromise involving ePHI

## The clinic playbook (step-by-step)

### Step 1: Contain and preserve evidence
- isolate affected accounts/systems
- preserve logs, emails, screenshots, and timestamps
- document who took actions and when

### Step 2: Investigate scope
- what systems were involved?
- what data types were involved?
- how many individuals could be impacted?
- which vendor(s) were involved?

### Step 3: Perform a breach risk assessment
Your documentation should clearly show the factors considered and the rationale for the decision. The output should be a written determination.

### Step 4: Decide and prepare notifications
When notification is required, prepare:
- patient notice content (plain language)
- media notice workflow (for large incidents, when applicable)
- regulatory notice workflow (as required)
- internal staff communications and scripted responses

### Step 5: Corrective actions and follow-up
- reset credentials, enforce MFA, adjust access
- update policies and training content if the incident revealed gaps
- add remediation items to your risk management plan

## What makes breach response “defensible”

If OCR ever reviews your response, the strength is in your records:
- a single incident record (timeline)
- evidence bundle (logs/screenshots/emails)
- risk assessment write-up
- notification letters and proof of sending
- remediation plan and completion proof

## Recommended documents to have ready (before an incident)

- incident response policy
- breach notification policy templates
- contact lists (legal counsel, insurer, IT, key vendors)
- a decision tree for incident severity and escalation

Build the workflow now so you’re not inventing it under pressure.
