# HIPAA Compliance on a Budget (Low-Cost Solutions)

**HIPAA compliance doesn't have to break the bank. Here's how to achieve compliance on a budget.**

Small practices often think HIPAA compliance is expensive. But you can achieve compliance for $500-2,000/year—much less than the $50-100k/year for a compliance officer.

## The Cost Reality

**What compliance costs:**
- Full-time compliance officer: $50-100k/year
- Part-time consultant: $5-10k one-time + $2-5k/year
- Compliance software: $499-1,500/year
- DIY with templates: $0-500

**The problem:** Most small practices think they need a compliance officer. You don't.
