# HIPAA Compliance for Physical Therapy Clinics

**PT clinics have unique HIPAA requirements. Here's what you need to know.**

Physical therapy clinics handle patient records, exercise programs, treatment plans, appointment schedules, and billing data—all protected health information (PHI) under HIPAA. If you're not compliant, you're risking fines, audits, and patient trust.

## Why PT Clinics Are Different

**PT clinics face unique challenges:**

- **Exercise programs**: Digital exercise programs may store patient data
- **Treatment plans**: Detailed treatment documentation is PHI
- **Billing services**: Third-party billing requires BAAs
- **EHR systems**: PT-specific EHRs need security controls
- **Appointment systems**: Patient scheduling data is PHI

**The problem:** Most PT clinics don't realize they need HIPAA compliance until they get an audit notice.

## PT Clinic HIPAA Checklist

### 1. Privacy Policies

**Required:**
- Privacy Notice (Notice of Privacy Practices)
- Patient authorization forms
- Minimum necessary policy
- Patient rights documentation

**PT-specific:**
- Exercise program data policy
- Treatment plan sharing policy
- Appointment reminder policy

### 2. Security Policies

**Required:**
- Security policies covering all three safeguard categories
- Access control policies
- Encryption policies

**PT-specific:**

### 3. Business Associate Agreements (BAAs)

**PT clinics typically need BAAs with:**
- Billing services
- EHR providers
- Exercise program software providers
- Cloud storage providers

**Most PT clinics miss:** BAAs with exercise program software and billing services.

### 4. Risk Assessment

**PT-specific risks:**
- Exercise program software access
- EHR system access

**Required:** Annual risk assessment documenting all risks and mitigation strategies.

### 5. Staff Training

**Required:**
- HIPAA training for all staff

**Most PT clinics fail:** Incomplete training records or missing annual training.
