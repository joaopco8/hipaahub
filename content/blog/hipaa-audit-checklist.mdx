# HIPAA Audit Checklist: What Auditors Look For (2026)

**Your OCR audit is coming. Are you ready?**

Most clinics aren't. Here's the complete checklist of what auditors check—and where most practices fail.

## The Reality of HIPAA Audits

When an OCR auditor arrives at your practice, they're not just checking boxes. They're looking for **proof** that you're actually compliant, not just compliant on paper.

**The problem:** Most clinics have their documentation scattered across 5-10 different places. When the auditor asks for a specific policy or evidence file, they can't find it. That's when fines start.

**The solution:** Organization. If you can show the auditor everything they need in 5 minutes, you pass. If you can't, you fail.

## The 50-Item Audit Checklist

Here's exactly what auditors check, in order of importance:

### Administrative Safeguards (Items 1-20)

1. **Privacy Policy** - Is it documented? Is it signed? Is it current?
2. **Security Policy** - Does it cover all three safeguard categories?
3. **Designated Privacy Officer** - Is someone assigned? Is it documented?
4. **Designated Security Officer** - Is someone assigned? Is it documented?
5. **Workforce Security Policy** - Do you have hiring and termination procedures?
6. **Information Access Management** - Who has access to PHI? Is it documented?
7. **⚠️ Security Awareness Training** - **Most clinics fail here.** Do you have training records for ALL staff? Are certificates current?
8. **Contingency Plan** - What happens if systems go down?
9. **Business Associate Agreements (BAAs)** - Do you have BAAs for all vendors?
10. **Risk Assessment** - When was your last risk assessment? Is it documented?
11. **Incident Response Plan** - What happens if there's a breach?

39. **⚠️ Breach Detection** - **Most clinics fail here.** How do you detect breaches?
40. **Breach Response** - What happens when a breach is detected?

### Documentation and Evidence (Items 41-50)

41. **⚠️ Evidence Organization** - **Most clinics fail here.** Can you find evidence quickly?
42. **Policy Version Control** - Are policies versioned?
43. **Training Records** - Are training records complete?
44. **Attestations** - Are policies signed and dated?
45. **Risk Assessment Documentation** - Is it complete?

## Where Most Clinics Fail

Based on OCR enforcement data, here are the top failure points:

1. **Item #7: Security Awareness Training** - 68% of clinics fail here. Missing training records, expired certificates, or incomplete training logs.

2. **Item #23: Device and Media Controls** - 54% of clinics fail here. Unencrypted devices, missing device inventories, or improper disposal.

3. **Item #41: Evidence Organization** - 72% of clinics fail here. Documentation is scattered, can't find files quickly, or missing critical evidence.

## How to Pass Your Audit

The secret to passing a HIPAA audit isn't having perfect policies. It's being **organized**.

When an auditor asks for a specific document, you need to find it in seconds, not hours. That's the difference between passing and failing.

**Here's what you need:**

1. **All 9 required policies** - Documented, signed, and current
2. **Evidence for all 48 evidence fields** - Organized and searchable
3. **Training records** - Complete for all staff
4. **Risk assessment** - Documented and current
5. **BAAs** - On file for all vendors
6. **Breach response plan** - Documented and tested
