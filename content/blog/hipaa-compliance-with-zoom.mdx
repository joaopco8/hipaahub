# HIPAA Compliance with Zoom (Telehealth Video)

**Zoom can be HIPAA-compliant, but you need the right version and setup. Here's how.**

Zoom is popular for telehealth, but regular Zoom is NOT HIPAA-compliant. You need Zoom Healthcare with a Business Associate Agreement (BAA). Here's everything you need to know.

## Zoom HIPAA Compliance Basics

**Two versions of Zoom:**
1. **Regular Zoom**: NOT HIPAA-compliant
2. **Zoom Healthcare**: HIPAA-compliant (with BAA)

**The problem:** Most practices use regular Zoom and think they're compliant. They're not.

### 1. Subscribe to Zoom Healthcare

**What you need:**
- Zoom Healthcare plan (not regular Zoom)
- Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with Zoom
- Proper security configuration

**Cost:** $200/month per license (varies by plan)
