# HIPAA Compliance for Pediatric Practices (Pediatrician Compliance)

**Pediatric practices have unique HIPAA requirements. Here's what you need to know.**

Pediatricians handle parent consent, minor patient rights, and family access differently than adult practices. You need to understand how HIPAA applies to minors and when state laws may restrict access.

## Why Pediatric Practices Are Different

**Pediatric practices face unique challenges:**

- **Parent consent**: Parents are generally personal representatives of minor children
- **Minor patient rights**: Minors have limited rights under HIPAA
- **Family access**: Parents can generally access minor children's records
- **State law restrictions**: Some states restrict parent access in certain situations
- **Reproductive health**: Special rules for reproductive health services
- **Mental health**: Special rules for mental health services

**The problem:** Most pediatric practices don't understand how HIPAA applies to minors and when state laws restrict access.

## Pediatric HIPAA Requirements

- Substance abuse (federal law restricts access)

### 2. Minor Patient Rights

**Limited rights:**

- Parents exercise rights on behalf of minors
- State law may grant minors certain rights (varies by state)

**Special situations:**
- Emancipated minors (varies by state)
- Mature minors (varies by state)
- Court-ordered restrictions

### 3. Consent and Authorization

**Parent consent:**
- Parents can generally consent to treatment
- Parents can authorize disclosures
- State law may require minor consent in certain situations

**Special situations:**
- Reproductive health (varies by state)
