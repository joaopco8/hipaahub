# HIPAA Requirements for Mental Health Therapists (Solo Practitioners)

**Therapists have unique HIPAA requirements. Here's what you need to know.**

Mental health therapists handle sensitive patient information, therapy notes, telehealth sessions, and billing data—all protected health information (PHI) under HIPAA. Solo practitioners face additional challenges because they're often managing compliance alone.

## Why Therapists Are Different

**Therapy practices face unique challenges:**

- **Psychotherapy notes**: Enhanced protection under HIPAA
- **Telehealth sessions**: Video calls must be secure and HIPAA-compliant
- **Patient privacy**: Extra sensitivity around mental health information
- **Solo practice**: No compliance department to help
- **Billing services**: Third-party billing requires BAAs
- **EHR systems**: Therapy-specific EHRs need security controls

**The problem:** Most solo therapists don't realize they need HIPAA compliance until they get an audit notice or have a breach.

## Therapy Practice HIPAA Checklist

### 1. Privacy Policies

**Required:**
- Privacy Notice (Notice of Privacy Practices)
- Patient authorization forms
- Psychotherapy notes policy (special requirements)
- Minimum necessary policy

- Session recording policy (if applicable)
- Communication policy (email, text, phone)

- EHR providers
- Telehealth platforms (Zoom, Doxy.me, etc.)
- Cloud storage providers

**Most therapists miss:** BAAs with telehealth platforms and billing services.

### 4. Psychotherapy Notes Protection

**Special requirements:**
- Psychotherapy notes cannot be disclosed without patient authorization
- Even for treatment, payment, or healthcare operations
- Must be kept separate from regular progress notes

**Required:** Annual risk assessment documenting all risks and mitigation strategies.

### 7. Staff Training
