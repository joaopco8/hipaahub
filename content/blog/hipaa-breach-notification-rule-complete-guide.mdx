# HIPAA Breach Notification Rule: Complete Guide (Requirements & Timeline)

**A breach happened. You have 60 days. Here's everything you need to know.**

This complete guide covers the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule—what it is, when it applies, and how to comply.

## What is the Breach Notification Rule?

The HIPAA Breach Notification Rule requires healthcare providers to **notify patients, HHS, and in some cases, the media** when a breach of unsecured PHI occurs.

**Key points:**
- Applies to **unsecured PHI** only
- **60-day notification deadline** for patients
- Different timelines for HHS and media
- **Documentation required** for all breaches

**What is unsecured PHI?**
- PHI that is not encrypted or destroyed
- If PHI is encrypted and encryption key is not compromised, it's not a breach
- If PHI is destroyed (shredded, burned), it's not a breach

## What Constitutes a Breach?

A breach is the **acquisition, access, use, or disclosure** of PHI in a manner **not permitted by HIPAA** that **compromises the security or privacy** of the PHI.

### Examples of Breaches

**Common breach scenarios:**
- Lost or stolen laptop with unencrypted PHI
- Email sent to wrong patient
- Hacking incident
- Unauthorized access to patient records
- Paper records left in public place
- Vendor breach affecting your patients
- Employee accessing records without authorization

### Exceptions (Not Considered Breaches)

**These are NOT breaches:**
- **Encrypted data** that's lost (if encryption key wasn't compromised)
- **Unintentional disclosure** to authorized person within same organization
- **Good faith disclosure** that couldn't be prevented
- **Inadvertent disclosure** by authorized person to another authorized person
- **Disclosure** where you have good faith belief that unauthorized person couldn't retain information

## The 60-Day Rule

**You have 60 days from discovery to notify patients.**

**Key points:**
- Clock starts when you **know** (or should have known) about the breach
- Not when the breach occurred
- Not when you finish investigating
- **60 days. Period.**

**What happens if you miss the deadline?**
- Additional OCR fines
- OCR investigation
- Reputational damage
- Legal liability

## Breach Risk Assessment

Before notifying, you must assess whether the breach **poses a significant risk** of harm.

### Four Factors to Consider

**1. Nature and Extent of PHI**
- What types of information were involved?
- How much information?
- How sensitive is the information?

**2. Person Who Used/Disclosed PHI**
- Was it an authorized person?
- Was it an unauthorized person?
- What was their intent?

**3. Whether PHI Was Actually Acquired or Viewed**
- Was PHI actually accessed?
- Or was it just potentially accessible?
- Can you determine if it was viewed?

**4. Extent of Risk Mitigation**
- What steps have you taken?
- Can you mitigate the risk?
- Have you contained the breach?

### Presumption of Breach

**Breach is presumed** unless you can demonstrate **low probability** that PHI was compromised.

**To overcome presumption, you must show:**
- PHI was not actually acquired or viewed
- Risk of harm is low
- Mitigation steps were effective

## Patient Notification Requirements

### Timeline

**When:** Within 60 days of discovery

**Method:** Written notice (first-class mail) or email (if patient agreed to email)

**Content Required:**
1. **Description of breach** - What happened?
2. **Types of information involved** - What PHI was compromised?
3. **What you're doing** - Investigation, mitigation, prevention
4. **What patients should do** - Steps to protect themselves
5. **Contact information** - Who to call with questions

### Notification Letter Requirements

**Must be written in:**
- Plain language
- Clear and understandable
- Specific to the breach
- Actionable

**Must include:**
- Brief description of what happened
- Date of breach (if known) and date of discovery
- Types of information involved
- Steps you're taking to investigate and mitigate
- Steps patients should take to protect themselves
- Contact information for questions

### Sample Notification Letter Structure

```
Dear [Patient Name],

We are writing to inform you of a security incident that may have 
affected your protected health information.

- Breach description
- Number of individuals affected
- Types of PHI involved
- Steps taken to mitigate
- Patient notification status

### For Breaches Affecting Fewer Than 500 Individuals

**Timeline:** Within 60 days of the end of the calendar year

**Method:** OCR's breach notification form (online)

**Required information:**

- Same information as above for each breach

## Media Notification Requirements

### When Required

**Must notify media if:**
- Breach affects **500+ individuals**

- Contact information

### Media Outlets

**Notify prominent media outlets serving the affected area:**
- Major newspapers
- Television stations
- Radio stations
- Online news outlets

## Breach Response Process

### Step 1: Detect and Contain (Day 1)

**Immediate actions:**
- Detect the breach
- Contain it (stop further exposure)
- Document discovery
- Assess scope

**Containment steps:**
- Disable compromised accounts
- Change passwords
- Isolate affected systems
- Secure physical documents
- Recover lost devices (if possible)

### Step 2: Assess the Breach (Day 2-7)

**Assessment tasks:**
- Determine if it's a breach
- Assess risk of harm
- Identify affected individuals
- Determine scope
- Document findings

### Step 3: Notify Patients (Day 8-60)

**Notification tasks:**
- Prepare notification letters
- Send to all affected patients
- Track notifications sent
- Document all notifications

### Step 4: Notify HHS OCR (Day 8-60 or Year-End)

**Notification tasks:**
- Complete OCR breach form
- Submit within deadline
- Document submission

### Step 5: Notify Media (If Required) (Day 8-60)

**Notification tasks:**
- Identify media outlets
- Prepare media statement
- Send notifications
- Document notifications

### Step 6: Document Everything (Ongoing)

**Documentation tasks:**
- Document discovery
- Document assessment
- Document containment
- Document notifications
- Document remediation
- Maintain for 6 years

## Documentation Requirements

### What to Document

**Required documentation:**
1. **Breach discovery** - When, how, who discovered
2. **Breach assessment** - Risk analysis, scope determination
3. **Containment steps** - What was done to stop breach
4. **Investigation** - Findings, root cause analysis
5. **Notifications sent** - When, to whom, method
6. **Remediation** - Steps taken to prevent future breaches

### Why Documentation Matters

**Documentation is critical because:**
- Required for audits
- Shows good faith effort
- Reduces potential fines
- Demonstrates compliance
- Protects in legal proceedings

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Waiting Too Long

**Problem:** Waiting to finish investigation before notifying

**Solution:** Notify within 60 days, even if investigation is ongoing

### Mistake 2: Incomplete Notifications

**Problem:** Missing required information

**Solution:** Use checklist to ensure all elements included

### Mistake 3: Poor Documentation

**Problem:** Not documenting breach response

**Solution:** Document everything from day 1

### Mistake 4: Not Notifying OCR

**Problem:** Forgetting to notify OCR for small breaches

**Solution:** Log all breaches and notify OCR annually

## Prevention is Better Than Response

**The best breach response is preventing breaches:**

1. **Encrypt all devices** - Laptops, phones, tablets
2. **Train your staff** - On HIPAA and security
3. **Use secure systems** - HIPAA-compliant software
4. **Monitor access** - Audit logs and alerts
5. **Have a plan** - Breach response plan ready
