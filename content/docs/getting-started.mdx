## Welcome to HIPAA Hub

HIPAA Hub helps small healthcare practices achieve and maintain HIPAA compliance. This guide will walk you through your first steps.

## Step 1: Complete Your Organization Profile

When you first log in, you'll be asked to complete your organization profile. This information is used to customize your policies and documents.

**What you'll need:**
- Your practice name and address
- NPI number (if you have one)
- Number of employees
- Practice type (medical, dental, mental health, etc.)

**Why it matters:** This information ensures your policies are personalized to your practice.

## Step 2: Complete the Security Risk Analysis

The Security Risk Analysis (SRA) is the foundation of your compliance program. HIPAA Hub will ask you about 150+ questions covering:

- How you store patient information
- Your security measures
- Your technology systems
- Your policies and procedures

**Time required:** 30-60 minutes

**What happens next:** Based on your answers, HIPAA Hub will:
- Calculate your risk level (Low, Medium, High)
- Show you your compliance status
- Create a prioritized list of action items
- Identify what documentation you need

## Step 3: Generate Your Required Policies

HIPAA requires 9 core policies. HIPAA Hub can generate all of them automatically based on your organization profile and risk assessment.

**The 9 required policies:**
1. HIPAA Security & Privacy Master Policy
2. Security Risk Analysis Policy
3. Risk Management Plan
4. Access Control Policy
5. Workforce Training Policy
6. Sanction Policy
7. Incident Response & Breach Notification Policy
8. Business Associate Management Policy
9. Audit Logs & Documentation Retention Policy

**How to generate:**
1. Go to the Policies section
2. Click "Generate" for each policy
3. Review and approve each document
4. Download or save as needed

## Step 4: Upload Evidence

Evidence proves you're following your policies. For each policy, you can upload:
- Training certificates
- Security configurations
- Incident reports
- Audit logs
- Any other documentation that shows compliance

**Why it matters:** Auditors want to see proof, not just policies. Connecting evidence to policies shows you're actually compliant.

## Step 5: Assign Employee Training

All staff members who handle patient information must complete HIPAA training. HIPAA Hub helps you:
- Assign training to employees
- Track completion status
- Generate certificates
- Set up renewal reminders

## Step 6: Review Your Action Items

After completing your risk assessment, HIPAA Hub creates a prioritized list of action items. These are things you need to do to improve your compliance.

**Action items are organized by:**
- Priority: Critical, High, Medium, Low
- Risk level: What happens if you don't address this
- Timeline: When it should be completed

## Step 7: Export Your Audit Package

When you're ready (or when an auditor arrives), you can export a complete audit package with one click. This includes:
- All your policies
- Risk assessment reports
- Training records
- Evidence files
- Organization information

Everything is organized and ready to present to an auditor.
