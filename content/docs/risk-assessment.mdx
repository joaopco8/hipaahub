## What is a Security Risk Analysis?

A Security Risk Analysis (SRA) is required by HIPAA. It's a comprehensive evaluation of how you protect patient information. HIPAA Hub guides you through this process with 150+ questions.

## Why It Matters

The SRA helps you:
- Identify security risks
- Understand your compliance gaps
- Prioritize what to fix first
- Create a roadmap for improvement
- Prove to auditors that you've assessed your risks

## How to Complete Your SRA

### Step 1: Access the Risk Assessment

1. Go to your Dashboard
2. Click "Risk Assessment" in the sidebar
3. Click "Start Assessment" or "Continue Assessment"

### Step 2: Answer the Questions

HIPAA Hub will ask you about:

**Technology & Systems**
- What EHR system you use
- How you store patient data
- Your email and communication tools
- Cloud services you use
- Backup and recovery procedures

**Physical Security**
- Office access controls
- How you secure devices
- Where patient information is stored physically
- Visitor access procedures

**Administrative Safeguards**
- Who has access to patient information
- How you train employees
- Your incident response procedures
- How you manage business associates

**Technical Safeguards**
- Password policies
- Encryption methods
- Access controls
- Audit logging

**Time Required:** 30-60 minutes

**Tips:**
- Answer honestly - this helps you identify real risks
- Don't rush - take time to think about each question
- You can save and come back later
- If you're unsure, answer conservatively

### Step 3: Review Your Results

After completing the assessment, HIPAA Hub will show you:

**Your Risk Level:**
- **Low Risk:** Good security practices, minimal gaps
- **Medium Risk:** Some areas need improvement
- **High Risk:** Significant gaps that need attention

**Your Risk Score:** A percentage showing your overall risk level

**Action Items:** A prioritized list of things to fix

**Compliance Status:** How ready you are for an audit

## Understanding Your Risk Level

### Low Risk (Green)
- Strong security practices
- Most requirements met
- Minor improvements needed
- Generally audit-ready

**What to do:** Maintain your current practices, address any action items

### Medium Risk (Yellow)
- Good foundation
- Some gaps need attention
- Improvements needed in specific areas
- May need work before audit

**What to do:** Focus on high-priority action items, generate missing policies

### High Risk (Red)
- Significant security gaps
- Critical improvements needed
- Not ready for audit
- Immediate action required

**What to do:** Address critical action items first, complete all policies, upload evidence

## Action Items from Your SRA

After completing your assessment, HIPAA Hub creates action items based on your answers. These are organized by:

**Priority:**
- **Critical:** Must be addressed immediately
- **High:** Should be addressed soon
- **Medium:** Important but not urgent
- **Low:** Nice to have improvements

**Category:**
- Missing policies
