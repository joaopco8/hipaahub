## What is Evidence?

Evidence proves you're following your policies. It's the documentation that shows auditors you're actually compliant, not just compliant on paper.

**Examples of evidence:**
- Training certificates
- Security configuration screenshots
- Incident reports
- Audit logs
- Signed policy acknowledgments
- Business associate agreements
- Access control logs
- Backup verification records

## Why Evidence Matters

Auditors don't just want to see your policies. They want to see **proof** that you're following them. Evidence connects your policies to your actual practices.

**Without evidence:**
- Policies are just documents
- No proof of compliance
- Auditors may question your practices

**With evidence:**
- Policies are supported by proof
- Clear demonstration of compliance
- Auditors can verify your practices

## How to Upload Evidence

### Step 1: Go to Evidence Section

1. From your Dashboard, click "Evidence" in the sidebar
2. You'll see a list of all evidence requirements
3. Each item shows whether evidence has been uploaded

### Step 2: Select a Policy

1. Click on a policy that needs evidence
2. You'll see what evidence is required for that policy
3. Click "Upload Evidence" or "Attach Document"

### Step 3: Upload Your File

1. Click "Choose File" or drag and drop
2. Select your file (PDF, image, Word doc, etc.)
3. Add a description explaining what the evidence shows
4. Click "Upload"

**Supported formats:**
- PDF files
- Images (JPG, PNG)
- Word documents (.docx)
- Text files

**File size limit:** 10MB per file

### Step 4: Connect to Policies

When you upload evidence, you can connect it to:
- Specific policies it supports
- Risk assessment controls
- Training records
- Incident reports

**Why connect?** This creates a clear map showing how your evidence supports your compliance.

## Evidence Requirements

HIPAA Hub identifies what evidence you need based on:
- Your risk assessment answers
- Your policies
- HIPAA requirements
- Best practices

**Common evidence requirements:**
- Training completion certificates
- Security configuration documentation
- Access control logs
- Incident response records
- Business associate agreements
- Backup verification
- Encryption documentation

## Organizing Your Evidence

### By Policy
Group evidence by which policy it supports. This makes it easy for auditors to see how you're following each policy.

### By Category
Organize by type:
- Training records
- Security documentation
- Incident reports
- Administrative records

### By Date
Keep evidence organized chronologically, especially for:
- Annual assessments
- Training renewals
- Policy updates

## Evidence Status

Each evidence item can have one of these statuses:

**Missing**
- Required evidence hasn't been uploaded
- Shown as an action item
- Needs attention

**Uploaded**
- File has been uploaded
- Connected to policies
- Ready for review

**Expired**
- Evidence is outdated (e.g., old training certificate)
- Needs to be updated
- You'll get a warning

**Valid**
- Current and up to date
- Properly connected
- Ready for audit

## Best Practices

**Upload Regularly**
- Don't wait until audit time
- Upload evidence as you create it
- Keep it current

**Be Descriptive**
- Add clear descriptions
- Explain what the evidence shows
- Make it easy for auditors to understand

**Keep It Organized**
- Use clear file names
- Group related evidence
- Connect to the right policies

**Update Expired Evidence**
- Renew training certificates
- Update security documentation
- Keep everything current

## Common Questions

**Q: What if I don't have evidence for something?**
A: Create it. For example, if you need training certificates, complete the training and generate the certificate.

**Q: How much evidence do I need?**
A: Enough to prove you're following each policy. One piece of evidence per policy is a minimum, but more is better.

**Q: Can I upload the same evidence for multiple policies?**
A: Yes, if it supports multiple policies, you can connect it to all of them.

**Q: What if my evidence is confidential?**
A: All evidence is stored securely and encrypted. Only authorized users can access it.

**Q: How long should I keep evidence?**
A: HIPAA requires keeping documentation for 6 years. HIPAA Hub stores everything securely.
