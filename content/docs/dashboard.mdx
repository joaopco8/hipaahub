## What is the Dashboard?

Your dashboard is your command center. It shows you at a glance:
- Your current compliance status
- What needs attention
- Your progress toward full compliance
- Quick actions you can take

## Compliance Status

At the top of your dashboard, you'll see your compliance status:

**✅ Compliant (Green)**
- Low risk level
- All critical requirements met
- Ready for audit

**⚠️ Attention Needed (Yellow)**
- Medium risk level
- Some gaps need to be addressed
- Most requirements met

**❌ At Risk (Red)**
- High risk level
- Critical gaps need immediate attention
- Not ready for audit

## Key Metrics

Your dashboard shows several important numbers:

### Action Items
- **Total:** All items that need attention
- **Critical:** Must be addressed immediately
- **High Priority:** Should be addressed soon

### Policies
- **Completed:** How many of the 9 required policies you've generated
- **Total:** Always 9 (the required number)

### Training
- **Employees Trained:** Staff who have completed HIPAA training
- **Total Employees:** All staff members in your system

### Evidence
- **Valid:** Evidence files that are properly connected to policies
- **Missing:** Evidence that still needs to be uploaded

## Action Items Section

This is your to-do list. Action items are created automatically based on:
- Your risk assessment answers
- Missing policies
- Expired training
- Missing evidence

**Each action item shows:**
- What needs to be done
- Why it matters
- Priority level
- Due date (if applicable)

**To complete an action item:**
1. Click on the item
2. Follow the instructions
3. Mark it as complete when done

## Understanding Your Compliance Score

Your compliance score is a percentage (0-100%) that reflects:
- Risk assessment results
- Policy completion
- Training completion
- Evidence coverage
- Action item completion

**How to improve your score:**
1. Complete your risk assessment
2. Generate all 9 required policies
3. Upload evidence for each policy
4. Complete employee training
5. Address action items, starting with critical ones
