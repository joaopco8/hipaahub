## The 9 Required HIPAA Policies

HIPAA requires every covered entity to have 9 core policies. HIPAA Hub can generate all of them automatically, customized to your practice.

## Policy Overview

### 1. HIPAA Security & Privacy Master Policy
Your main policy document that covers all HIPAA requirements and references your other policies.

### 2. Security Risk Analysis Policy
Defines how and when you conduct risk assessments, and how you use the results.

### 3. Risk Management Plan
Documents how you identify, assess, and mitigate security risks.

### 4. Access Control Policy
Defines who can access patient information, how access is granted, and how it's monitored.

### 5. Workforce Training Policy
Outlines HIPAA training requirements for all staff members.

### 6. Sanction Policy
Describes disciplinary procedures for HIPAA violations.

### 7. Incident Response & Breach Notification Policy
Explains how you detect, respond to, and report security incidents and breaches.

### 8. Business Associate Management Policy
Defines how you manage relationships with vendors who handle patient information.

### 9. Audit Logs & Documentation Retention Policy
Specifies what logs you keep, how long you keep them, and how they're protected.

## How to Generate Policies

### Step 1: Go to Policies Section

1. From your Dashboard, click "Policies" in the sidebar
2. You'll see a list of all 9 required policies
3. Each policy shows its status: Not Generated, Draft, or Approved

### Step 2: Generate a Policy

1. Click on a policy you want to generate
2. Click the "Generate" button
3. HIPAA Hub will create the policy using:
   - Your organization information
   - Your risk assessment answers
   - HIPAA requirements
   - Best practices

**Time required:** 1-2 minutes per policy

### Step 3: Review and Edit

After generation, you can:
- Review the content
- Edit any sections
- Add your own information
- Customize to your practice

**Important:** Review each policy to ensure it reflects your actual practices.

### Step 4: Approve the Policy

Once you're satisfied:
1. Click "Approve"
2. The policy is marked as approved
3. It's ready for use and audit

### Step 5: Attach Your Own Documents

If you already have a policy document:
1. Click "Attach Document"
2. Upload your file (PDF, Word, etc.)
3. Add a description
4. The document is linked to that policy

## Policy Status

Each policy can have one of these statuses:

**Not Generated**
- Policy hasn't been created yet
- Click "Generate" to create it

**Draft**
- Policy has been generated but not approved
- You can still edit it
- Not considered "complete" until approved

**Approved**
- Policy has been reviewed and approved
- Ready for use
- Counts toward your compliance score

## Attaching Existing Documents

If you already have policies from another source:

1. Go to the policy page
2. Click "Attach Document"
3. Upload your file
4. Add a name and description
5. Save

**Supported formats:** PDF, Word (.docx), Text files

**Why this matters:** You don't have to regenerate policies you already have. Just upload them.

## Version Control

HIPAA Hub automatically tracks:
- When policies were created
- When they were last updated
- Who approved them
- Version history

**To update a policy:**
1. Make your edits
2. Save changes
3. Approve the new version
4. Previous versions are kept for audit trail

## Best Practices

- Make sure the policy matches your actual practices
- Update any generic information
- Add practice-specific details

**Keep Policies Updated**
- Review policies annually
- Update when your practices change
- Keep them current with HIPAA requirements

**Store Securely**
- Policies are stored securely in HIPAA Hub
- You can download copies anytime
- All versions are preserved
