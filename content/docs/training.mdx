## Why Training Matters

HIPAA requires all staff members who handle patient information to complete HIPAA training. This includes:
- Doctors and nurses
- Administrative staff
- Receptionists
- Billing staff
- Anyone who accesses patient records

**Training helps:**
- Ensure staff understand HIPAA requirements
- Reduce the risk of violations
- Create a culture of compliance
- Provide proof of training for auditors

## How to Assign Training

### Step 1: Add Staff Members

1. Go to the Training section
2. Click "Add Employee" or "Manage Staff"
3. Enter employee information:
   - Name
   - Email
   - Role
   - Department

### Step 2: Assign Training

1. Select the employees who need training
2. Click "Assign Training"
3. Choose the training module
4. Set a due date (optional)

**Training modules available:**
- HIPAA Basics
- Privacy and Security
- Breach Notification
- Patient Rights

### Step 3: Employees Complete Training

1. Employees receive an email notification
2. They log in to HIPAA Hub
3. They complete the training module
4. They take a quiz to demonstrate understanding
5. They receive a certificate upon completion

## Tracking Training Status

You can see at a glance:

**Completed**
- Employee has finished training
- Certificate has been generated
- Counts toward compliance

**In Progress**

**Expired**

## Training Certificates

When an employee completes training:
- A certificate is automatically generated
- It includes:
  - Employee name
  - Training module completed
  - Completion date
  - Certificate number
- It's stored in HIPAA Hub
- It can be downloaded or printed

**Why certificates matter:** They're evidence that training was completed, which auditors will want to see.

## Annual Renewal

HIPAA training should be renewed annually. HIPAA Hub will:
- Track when training expires
- Send reminders 30 days before expiration
- Show expired training on your dashboard
- Make it easy to reassign training
