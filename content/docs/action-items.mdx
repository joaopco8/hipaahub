## What are Action Items?

Action items are tasks you need to complete to improve your HIPAA compliance. HIPAA Hub automatically creates them based on:
- Your risk assessment answers
- Missing policies
- Expired training
- Missing evidence
- Security gaps

## Why They Matter

Action items help you:
- Know exactly what to do next
- Prioritize the most important tasks
- Track your progress
- Never miss critical requirements

## How Action Items are Created

HIPAA Hub automatically creates action items when:
- You complete your risk assessment
- Policies are missing or need updates
- Training certificates expire
- Evidence is missing for policies
- Security gaps are identified

## Understanding Priority Levels

Action items are organized by priority:

### Critical (Red)
- Must be addressed immediately
- High risk if not completed
- Could result in violations
- Examples: Missing security policies, expired training for key staff

### High (Orange)
- Should be addressed soon
- Important for compliance
- Should be done within 30 days
- Examples: Missing evidence, outdated policies

### Medium (Yellow)
- Important but not urgent
- Should be done within 90 days
- Examples: Policy updates, additional training

### Low (Blue)
- Nice to have improvements
- Can be done when convenient
- Examples: Additional documentation, optional training

A: It depends on your compliance status. New users typically have 20-50 items. As you complete them, the number decreases.

**Q: What if I can't complete an item?**
A: Add a note explaining why. Some items may need to be deferred, but document the reason.

**Q: Do action items expire?**
A: They don't expire, but they should be addressed based on priority. Critical items need immediate attention.

**Q: Can I create my own action items?**
A: Currently, action items are created automatically. You can add notes to existing items.

A: Your compliance score improves, and you'll be in better shape for audits. New items may appear as requirements change.
